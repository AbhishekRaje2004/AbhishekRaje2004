# Abhishek Raje

I am Abhishek, a third-year Biomedical Engineering undergrad at IIT Hyderabad with a dual degree in Mathematics & Computing. I'm interested in systems-level mathematical modeling of biophysical/neural systems. My interests include medical imaging/image and signal processing and statistical optimization methods. Additionally, I enjoy programming neuromorphic algorithms for human-like intelligent systems based on biological principles.

##  Interests
- Mathematical modeling of biological systems
- Stochastic simulations
- Signal  & image processing
- Neuromorphic algorithms
- Computational oncology


##   Projects

### Hybrid Multi-Scale Tumor Growth with Integrated Angiogenesis in-Silico Model
- Developed an in-silico model simulating tumor growth with integrated angiogenesis
- Integrated Cytotoxic T-Cells with a time-based stochastic model to simulate tumor apoptosis
- Used finite elements analysis for simulation dynamics governed by ODEs and PDEs

### Bio-Inspired Stochastic Convolution Neural Network
- Implemented a CNN for multi-class image classification from scratch using Linear Algebra based library NumPy
- Utilized stochastic determination of key points for convolution using bi-variate Gaussian random variables
- Inspired by the stochastic saccading mechanism of the visual system


### Analyzing and Modeling  Investment Scenarios for ASEAN Countries
- Implemented a statistical model using Python-based libraries for time series forecasting. Appropriate regression models were built to
  ensure statistical significance and data fit.
- Performed numerical optimization using an iterative algorithm for cost-benefit and investment modeling for Policy decisions modeling for ASEAN countries
